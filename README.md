## Introduction

This project is a real estate website built using React as the frontend framework and Vite as the build tool. It's designed to showcase property listings and details, allowing users to search for properties based on various criteria.

## Features

- Property listings with images, descriptions, and pricing.
- Property search based on location, property type, and price range.
- Detailed property view with interactive map integration.
- Contact form for inquiries about specific properties.
- Responsive design for seamless use on different devices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MVKarthikReddy/Rent_A_Property.git
cd Rent_A_Property
```

2. Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update the configuration settings as needed.

2. Obtain API keys for any third-party services (e.g., Google Maps API) and update them in the `.env` file.

## Usage

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the development server, and you can access the website in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## API Integration

The project integrates with a real estate API to fetch property data. API endpoints are defined in the `src/api` directory. Make sure to review and update the API integration according to your requirements.

## Deployment

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized production-ready files in the `dist` directory.

You can then deploy these files to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.
